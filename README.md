# MRI_Classification_Project

Introduction
------------
This project is based on a classification task using MRI and biomarker data from the ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) and MCSA databases.

Data Overview
-------------
For this study, the data from the ADNI database is divided into training and validation sets, with each ID used only once. The specific data are as follows:

Subjects with AGE, MMSE, and APOE4 information:
- AD (Alzheimer's Disease): 202
- CN (Cognitively Normal): 575
- MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment): 495

All images for each subject are included in the calculations to ensure comprehensive and accurate data. Additionally, the DX (diagnosis) classification for records with path, AGE, MMSE, and APOE4 information is as follows:
- CN (Cognitively Normal): 1186 records
- MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment): 1184 records
- Dementia: 532 records

Data Files
----------
The relevant ADNI CSV files that may be needed for this study have been uploaded. These files contain the necessary metadata and labels for the MRI and biomarker data.
